This is an example of atomic Green's function solving for graphene's phonon transmission. Below are the detailed steps.
1. Calculate harmonic force constant using phonopy ----> FORCE_CONSTANTS
2. Use the SPOSCAR file generated by phonopy to divide the system into three regions (left lead, scattering region, and rightlead) ---->layer_map
3. Run the script hm.py to obtain the interaction matrix.
4. Run the script agf.py to obtain the phonon transmission.
5. Any discussion is welcomed (email: wujing_53@163.com)
